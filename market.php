                Unfortunately, hydrogen does not exist in its pure form on Earth and must be extracted from sources that
                contain hydrogen, such as hydrocarbons (hydrogen + carbon) and water (hydrogen + oxygen). Nearly all the
                hydrogen today is made from hydrocarbons like coal, oil, and natural gas, which are dirty and limited
                resources. Water, on the other hand, is an infinite and renewable worldwide resource.

                Accordingly to Grandview Research, hydrogen is a $155 billion market today and nearly all of it is made
                from natural gas. Goldman Sachs projected that hydrogen will be a $12 trillion market in the future if
                it can be made green by using renewable resources such as sun, wind and water.

                Green hydrogen is crucial in meeting the greenhouse gas emission goals described in United Nation’s
                Paris Agreement. Solar, wind and batteries alone simply cannot be relied upon to decarbonize industries,
                such as aviation, maritime, steel, cement, fertilizers, oil refining and pharmaceuticals. The expected
                global drive towards “net-zero emission” by 2050 will create tremendous demand for green hydrogen for
                decades to come.
