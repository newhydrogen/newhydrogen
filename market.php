            Unfortunately, hydrogen does not exist in its pure form on Earth and
            must be extracted from sources that contain hydrogen, such as
            hydrocarbons (hydrogen + carbon) and water (hydrogen + oxygen).
            Nearly all the hydrogen today is made from hydrocarbons like coal, oil,
            and natural gas, which are dirty and limited resources. Water, on the
            other hand, is an infinite and renewable worldwide resource.

            Accordingly to Grandview Research, hydrogen is a $155 billion market
            today and nearly all of it is made from natural gas. Goldman Sachs
            projected that hydrogen will be a $12 trillion market in the future if it can
            be made green by using renewable resources such as sun, wind and
            water.

            Green hydrogen is crucial in meeting the greenhouse gas emission goals
            described in United Nation’s Paris Agreement. Solar, wind and batteries
            alone simply cannot be relied upon to decarbonize industries, such as
            aviation, maritime, steel, cement, fertilizers, oil refining and
            pharmaceuticals. The expected global drive towards “net-zero emission”
            by 2050 will create tremendous demand for green hydrogen for decades
            to come.
