                        uncomfortably forged between energy
                        producing countries and energy consuming
                        countries. This new world order propelled
                        humanity into an era of prosperity and
                        ambition, as well as an era of climate change
                        and instability where a select few nations
                        control natural resources such as oil, gas and
                        coal.

                        <p>For more than 100 years, the gold standard for producing green hydrogen is through
                            electrolysis, using electrolyzers with solar or wind energy to split water into hydrogen and
                            oxygen. However, electrolyzers are very expensive and their
                            efficiencies are fundamentally limited by the natural laws of thermodynamics. For example,
                            the theoretical voltage required to split water is 1.23V, but in real life, the voltage
                            required in an industrial electrolyzer is closer to 2V, sometimes more. This
                            60% or more of additional energy is wasted and not put into hydrogen molecules.</p>

                            <p>Working with a team of world-class chemical and materials engineers at UC Santa Barbara (UCSB), we are developing a better way to efficiently split water into cheap green hydrogen with a thermochemical approach, using heat instead of electricity. The UCSB team plans to exploit the oxidation reduction features of multi-component materials including high temperature liquids to directly split water continuously in a series of chemical looping reactions, producing hydrogen and oxygen in separate reaction chambers. The concept has been at work in other applications for some time at UCSB and we decided to sponsor research to apply the methodology to water splitting.</p>

                    <h4>NewHydrogen ThermoLoop™ A Better Form of Electrolyzer</h4>
                    <p>Electrolyzers require electricity, a fundamentally less efficient form of energy and projected to
                        be 60% the cost of producing green hydrogen even by 2030. Most electricity is made from the
                        inefficient burning of fossil fuels to boil water, to make steam, to turn a turbine, which
                        produces electricity. Alternative sources of energy, such as sun and wind, are intermittent.
                        When the sun shines, solar panels only convert 20% of solar
                        energy into electricity. Wind turbines can produce electricity, but the wind is less predictable
                        than the sun. By using heat as the power source for the NewHydrogen ThermoLoop, we cut out the
                        middleman – electricity – and go straight to the heat
                        source. Concentrated solar heat, nuclear waste heat, or industrial waste heat are extremely low
                        cost compared to electricity and can be used to power our ThermoLoop process. <br><br>

                        In areas where electricity is more readily available than high temperature heat, we envision the
                        use of a readily available high efficiency electric heater to supply heat to the NewHydrogen
                        ThermoLoop process. While our ThermoLoop may look like a standard electrolyzer, the similarities
                        stop there: it will be faster, cheaper, simpler, and more efficient.</p>

                <h4>UCSB Team</h4>
                <p>The UCSB team plans to exploit the oxidation reduction features of multi-component materials including high temperature liquids to directly split water continuously in a series of chemical looping reactions, producing hydrogen and oxygen in separate reaction chambers. The concpet has been at work in other applications for some time ay UCSB and the Company decided to sponsor research to apply the methodology to water splitting. <br><br> The research team at UCSB is led by Dr. Philip Christopher, an expert in reaction engineering and
                    catalysis. The UCSB team has extensive of experience working with molten metals and molten liquids
                    chemistry, as well as extracting “blue” hydrogen from natural gas with carbon capture using molten
                    metals. UCSB is ranked one of the top research universities in the world and a global leader in
                    bioengineering, chemical and computational engineering, materials science, nanotechnology and
                    physics. UCSB boasts 6 Nobel Laureates (five in sciences and engineering) and one winner of the
                    prestigious Millennium Technology Prize. According to Times Higher
                    Education's 2021 World University Rankings, UCSB is ranked top 2 percent of the engineering programs
                    in the world in overall excellence, research influence, and innovation. <br><br> The ThermoLoop technology is currently in its early development stage. In June 2023, we entereded into a sponsored research agreement with the University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB) to perform this research and development work. During the term of the agreement, we have rights to negotiate an option or license to all resulting intellectual property and related technology.</p>
