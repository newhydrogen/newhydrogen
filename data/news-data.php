Dr. Emerson’s research primarily consists of three core competencies, which are experimental combustion system development, combustor diagnostics, and combustion theory and modeling. Ben’s combustion system development work spans a wide variety of applications, from small lab-scale burners to combustor rigs that test full-scale gas turbine combustor hardware. His combustor diagnostics work encompasses the state-of-the-art optical diagnostic techniques for reacting flow field measurements and imaging and aims to implement those techniques in both laboratory-scale and large-scale rig tests. Finally, Dr. Emerson’s combustion theory and modeling work is geared towards analysis of experimental datasets, development of reduced-order engineering tools, and the development of a suite of hydrodynamic stability analysis tools. Together, these core competencies form the pillars of Ben’s research, which facilitates the design of cleaner-burning combustion systems.  </p>"

In a 2020 research report, Goldman Sachs estimates that green hydrogen will be a “once in a lifetime” market opportunity worth more than $12 trillion.</p>"

It is the most abundant and prevalent clean energy in the universe, but as hydrogen does not exist in its pure form, it must be extracted. As of 2020, nearly 95% of hydrogen in the world is made by steam reforming of natural gas (“grey hydrogen”) or coal gasification (“brown hydrogen”). Both sources of hydrogen are basically different forms of dirty, carbon heavy, and non-renewable fossil fuels.</p>"

Today, electrolyzer technology is the only commercially available solution for doing so.</p>"

It is a promising and scalable option to produce “green hydrogen” using renewable electricity generated from wind and solar. Unfortunately, high efficiency electrolyzers are expensive and rely on rare earth materials such as platinum and iridium – literally stardust found only in asteroids. These materials account for nearly 50% of the cost of electrolyzers.</p>"
