While the system is heating up or cooling down, hydrogen is not being produced and excess energy is wasted. This is incredibly inefficient.</p>"

Dr. Emerson’s research primarily consists of three core competencies, which are experimental combustion system development, combustor diagnostics, and combustion theory and modeling. Ben’s combustion system development work spans a wide variety of applications, from small lab-scale burners to combustor rigs that test full-scale gas turbine combustor hardware. His combustor diagnostics work encompasses the state-of-the-art optical diagnostic techniques for reacting flow field measurements and imaging and aims to implement those techniques in both laboratory-scale and large-scale rig tests. Finally, Dr. Emerson’s combustion theory and modeling work is geared towards analysis of experimental datasets, development of reduced-order engineering tools, and the development of a suite of hydrodynamic stability analysis tools. Together, these core competencies form the pillars of Ben’s research, which facilitates the design of cleaner-burning combustion systems.  </p>"

However, green electricity is, and always will be very expensive. It accounts for 73% of the cost of green hydrogen and will continue to represent most of the cost in the future.” </p>"

Inexpensive sources of renewable heat can be obtained from concentrated solar, geothermal, nuclear reactors and industrial waste heat. Concentrated solar holds the most promise because it can be generated anywhere in the world using inexpensive mirrors.”  </p>"

The concept has been at work in other applications for some time at UCSB and the Company decided to sponsor research to apply the methodology to water splitting.

                "<p>Electrolysis, the process of using electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen molecules, is a promising option for “green hydrogen” produced by renewable solar generated electricity. Currently, the two leading technologies in the water electrolyzer market are alkaline and acidic proton exchange membrane-based (PEM), both of which have similar market share. PEM electrolyzers, are the more modern variants and show higher efficiency, lower energy consumption, and produces hydrogen of higher purity than alkaline water electrolyzers. Most importantly, PEM electrolyzers offer high dynamic ranges which are well suited for the intermittent nature of renewable energy such as solar and wind. However, one of the main challenges for widespread adoption of PEM electrolyzers is their reliance on expensive precious metals like platinum and iridium – literally stardust found only in asteroids.</p>"
