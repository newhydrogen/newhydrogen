                    <p>NewHydrogen is developing a breakthrough technology that uses water and heat instead of electricity to
                        produce the world’s cheapest green hydrogen. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Currently, the most common method of making green hydrogen is to split water into oxygen and
                        hydrogen with an electrolyzer using green electricity produced from solar or wind. However,
                        green electricity is and always will be very expensive. It currently accounts for 73% of the
                        cost of green hydrogen.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In most power plants, heat is generated first to run a steam turbine to produce electricity.
                        Therefore, by using heat directly we can skip the expensive process of making electricity, and
                        fundamentally lower the cost of green hydrogen. Inexpensive heat can be obtained from
                        concentrated solar, geothermal, nuclear reactors and industrial waste heat. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Working with a team of world-class chemical and materials engineers, we are developing a novel
                        low-cost thermochemical process to split water using heat, instead of electricity. Additionally,
                        we are developing innovative technologies to lower the cost of electrolyzers for the current
                        market.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Our mission is to help produce unlimited quantities of the world’s cheapest green hydrogen, and
                        usher in the green hydrogen economy that Goldman Sachs estimated to have a future market value
                        of $12 trillion.
