                    <p>NewHydrogen is developing ThermoLoop<sup>TM</sup> - a breakthrough technology that uses water and heat instead of electricity to
                        produce the world’s cheapest green hydrogen. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    Hydrogen is the cleanest and most abundant element in the universe, and we can’t live without it. Hydrogen is the key ingredient in making fertilizers needed to grow food for the world. It is also used for transportation, refining oil and making steel, glass, pharmaceuticals and more. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    Nearly all the hydrogen today is made from hydrocarbons like coal, oil, and natural gas, which are dirty and limited resources. Water, on the other hand, is an infinite and renewable worldwide resource. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Currently, the most common method of making green hydrogen is to split water into oxygen and
                        hydrogen with an electrolyzer using green electricity produced from solar or wind. However,
                        green electricity is and always will be very expensive. It currently accounts for 73% of the
                        cost of green hydrogen.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>By using heat directly, we can skip the expensive process of making electricity, and
                        fundamentally lower the cost of green hydrogen. Inexpensive heat can be obtained from
                        concentrated solar, geothermal, nuclear reactors and industrial waste heat for use in our novel low-cost thermochemical water splitting process. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    Working with a world class research team at UC Santa Barbara, our goal is to help 
                        usher in the green hydrogen economy that Goldman Sachs estimated to have a future market value
                        of $12 trillion.
